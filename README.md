# OOP-Team-Profile-Generator
Welcome to my profile generator. The purpose for me to build this team profile generator is because it is a easy way for companies to manage their employees. By answering some simple questions from the NODE, users can easily make up a quick and easy profile on the website.

This program requires installation of inquirer npm and JEST for testing.

## Usage

In order to use this profile generator, first open up the node.js and install the latest inquirer. After that, install JEST for further testing. Type in 'npm test' to check if the codes are correct. After passing all the testings, typing in 'node index' to render the questions. Starting answer the questions for manager, the manager card will be built. After building the manager, the system will prompt with choices and ask the question: which of the following would you like to build? The users will be given three choices: engineer, intern or I am done. By choosing engineer or intern, the users will continuely build profile cards. By choosing I am done, the system will creat an HTML file which leads to the team profile website.
